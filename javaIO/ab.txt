Riding bike is the basic skill for most people, and they learn it when they are very small. I find few people can't ride bike and I feel pity for them, because it is hard for them to learn as the adults. I still remember the first time when I learn bike. It is the great achievement for me.
骑自行车是很多人的基本技能，他们在很小的时候就学会骑自行车。我发现只有少数人不会骑自行车，我很同情他们，因为他们很难像成年人一样去学了。我还记得我第一次学骑自行车的时候，那是我最大的成就。
